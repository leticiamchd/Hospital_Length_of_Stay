# Hospital_Length_of_Stay
Hospital length of stay (LoS) is the number of days that an in-patient will remain in hospital. LoS has long been used as a measure for hospitals so that they can better improve patient care, reduce overall costs, and appropriately allocate resources according to staff and patient needs. <br>

The goal of this EDA is to analyze the characteristics of longer Length of Stay (LoS) (here were considered LoS higher than 30 days). <br>
